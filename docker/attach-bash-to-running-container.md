# Attaching a bash shell to a running Docker container

Use `docker ps` to find the container ID:

    $ docker ps                        
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
    81b2ad3194cb        alexdebrie/livegrep-base:1   "/livegrep-github-reâ€¦"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes                            compassionate_yalow

Run `docker exec -it ID bash` to start a bash session in that container:

    $ docker exec -it 81b2ad3194cb bash

I made the mistake of using `docker attach 81b2ad3194cb` first, which attaches you to the command running as CMD in that conatiner, and means that if you hit `Ctrl+C` you exit that command and terminate the container!
