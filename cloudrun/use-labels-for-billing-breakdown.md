# Use labels on Cloud Run services for a billing breakdown

Thanks to [@glasnt](https://github.com/glasnt) for the tip on this one. If you want a per-service breakdown of pricing on your Google Cloud Run services within a project (each service is a different deployed application) the easiest way to do it is to apply labels to those services, then request a by-label pricing breakdown.

This command will update a service (restarting it) with a new label:

```bash
gcloud run services update csvconf --region=us-central1 --platform=managed --update-labels service=csvconf
```

I found it needed the `--platform=managed` and `--region=X` options to avoid it asking interactive questions.

Here's a bash script which loops through all of the services that do NOT have a `service` label and applies one:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for line in $(
  gcloud run services list --platform=managed \
    --format="csv(SERVICE,REGION)" \
    --filter "NOT metadata.labels.service:*" \
  | tail -n +2)
do
  IFS=$','; service_and_region=($line); unset IFS;
  service=${service_and_region[0]}
  region=${service_and_region[1]}
  echo "service: $service    region: $region"
  gcloud run services update $service \
    --region=$region --platform=managed \
    --update-labels service=$service
  echo
done
```

It runs the equivalent of this for each service:
```
gcloud run services update asgi-log-demo --region=us-central1 --platform=managed --update-labels service=asgi-log-demo
```

I saved that as a `runme.sh` script, run `chmod 755 runme.sh` and then  `./runme.sh` to run it.

The output of the script looked like this (one entry for each service) - each one took ~30s to run.

I had to wait a couple of days for this to take effect, but once it did I could get results by visiting Billing -> Reports, then selecting `service` from the group by menu here:

The graph (I picked bar chart over line chart) looked like this:

## Using the metrics explorer

Even without setting up these extra `service` labels the [Metrics explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/metrics-explorer) can show you breakdowns of billing time against different services.

Here's how to configure that:
