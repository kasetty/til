# Running Datasette on DigitalOcean App Platform

[App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/app-platform/) is the new PaaS from DigitalOcean. I figured out how to run Datasette on it.

The bare minimum needed is a GitHub repository with two files: `requirements.txt` and `Procfile`.

`requirements.txt` can contain a single line:
```
datasette
```
`Procfile` needs this:
```
web: datasette . -h 0.0.0.0 -p $PORT --cors
```

Your web process needs to listen on `0.0.0.0` and on the port in the `$PORT` environment variable.

Connect this GitHub repository up to DigitalOcean App Platform and it will deploy the application - detecting that it's a Python application (due to the `requirements.txt` file), installing those requirements and then starting up the process in the `Procfile`.

Any SQLite `.db` files that you add to the root of the GitHub repository will be automatically served by Datasette when it starts up.

Because Datasette is run using `datasette .` it will also automatically pick up a `metadata.json` file or anything in custom `templates/` or `plugins/` folders, as described in [Configuration directory mode](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/config.html#configuration-directory-mode) in the documentation.

## Building database files

I don't particularly like putting binary SQLite files in a GitHub repository - I prefer to store CSV files or SQL text files and build them into a database file as part of the deployment process.

The best way I've found to do this in a DigitalOcean App is to create a `build.sh` script that builds the database, then execute it using a `Build Command`.

One way to do this is to visit the "Components" tab end click "Edit" in the Commands section, then set the "Build Command" to `. build.sh`. Now any code you add to a `build.sh` script in your repo will be executed as part of the deployment.

A better way (thanks, [Kamal Nasser](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/configure-a-build-command-for-a-python-project-without-using-the-web-ui?comment=92105)) is to use a `bin/pre_compile` or `bin/post_compile` script in your repository.

I started with a `build.sh` script that looked like this:

```
wget https://latest.datasette.io/fixtures.db
```
And this resulted in the `fixtures.db` folder being served at `/fixtures` under my app's subdomain.
