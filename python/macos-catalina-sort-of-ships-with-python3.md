# macOS Catalina sort-of includes Python 3

Once you have installed the "command line tools" for Catalina using the following terminal command:

    xcode-select --install

`python3` will run Python 3.7.3:

    % which python3
    /usr/bin/python3
    % python3
    Python 3.7.3 (default, Apr  7 2020, 14:06:47) 
    [Clang 11.0.3 (clang-1103.0.32.59)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 

`pip` isn't there as a standalone tool on the command-line, but `python3 -mpip install x` will work:

```
python3 -mpip install github-to-sqlite

I don't like running `pip` as root, so I try the `--user` option:

```
% python3 -mpip install github-to-sqlite --user

pocket-to-sqlite 0.2 has requirement sqlite-utils~=2.4.4, but you'll have sqlite-utils 2.7 which is incompatible.

```
As per the warnings, this isn't on my path: I can run it like this:

```
/Users/simon/Library/Python/3.7/bin/github-to-sqlite
```
Or I can add that directory to my path.

Which I didn't do, because I decided to use homebrew's Python 3.8 instead, with `pipenv` and `pipx`:
```
% brew install pipenv
# ...
% brew install pipx
Updating Homebrew...

Now I'll try using it to install a command-line tool ([github-to-sqlite](https://github.com/dogsheep/github-to-sqlite)):
```
% pipx install github-to-sqlite
  installed package github-to-sqlite 1.1, Python 3.8.2

    - github-to-sqlite
‚ö†Ô∏è  Note: '/Users/simon/.local/bin' is not on your PATH environment variable. These apps will not be globally accessible until your PATH is updated. Run `pipx ensurepath` to automatically add it, or manually modify your PATH in your shell's config file (i.e. ~/.bashrc).
done! ‚ú® üåü ‚ú®
```
In this case I WILL add `~.local/bin` to my PATH:
```
% pipx ensurepath
```
This put the following in my `.zshrc`:
```
% cat .zshrc      

# Created by `userpath` on 2020-04-21 18:18:34
export PATH="$PATH:/Users/simon/.local/bin"
```
