# Get Skitch working on Catalina

I really like Skitch for taking screeshots, mainly because I like to snap a quick shot and then drag the icon onto a Google Doc or similar without saving the file anywhere.

Getting it working on Catalina was a bit tricky.

First, install it from the App Store.

Next, disable the default Shift+Command+5 system shortcut so Skitch can use it instead:

Then give Skitch permission to record your screen. Without that every screenshot will come out as a snippet of your desktop background!
